# Customizing your site

When executing tintin, it will generate a `.tintin.yml` file
with the following contents:

```yaml
color: blue
```

This is the tintin configuration file.

## Changing the color

The `color` setting tells tintin to render the website in one
of its different themes. The available colors are:

### blue

### purple

### lightGreen

## Changing the project title for a logo

Tintin also gives you the possibility of using your own logo.

To do so use the `logo` setting:

```yaml
color: blue
logo: https://github.com/theam/tintin/raw/master/assets/logo.svg
```

It is recommended that the logo has transparent background.
